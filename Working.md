What's currently in progress. Remove an item once it's done, tabled, or
shelved, don't mark it paused. Any session should read this and know what's
actually going on right now.

## HANDOVER - 2026-09-08

**State at a glance.** VM 103 (`df-colony-01`) is rebuilt, installed and
verified, but DF itself has not been started yet, so no world exists and
nothing is actually running unattended. The infrastructure this handover
opens with (below) is history now: VM 104 (`df-fortress`) and template 101
were both deleted 2026-09-01, not migrated, while this repo sat quiet since
2026-08-30. The Proxmox host was
reinstalled 2026-09-02 and renamed `SRV-01`; a two-node cluster `citadel`
formed 2026-09-01 and `SRV-01` rejoined it cleanly 2026-09-06. This project
got its own dedicated pool-scoped storage on 2026-09-08. The next action is a
**rebuild from this repo's own scripts** (`fetch-image` -> `build-template` ->
`clone`), not a restore of anything, and it is genuinely cheap: both pieces
were always meant to be reconstitutible this way, confirmed by reading the
code rather than assumed. Full analysis behind this handover:
`infra/local.2026-09-08-doc-reorg-plan.md` (gitignored: it quotes home-lab's
own infra specifics, so it lives under `infra/local.*` rather than `docs/`; a
clone of this public repo will not have it).

**Commit state.** Six local commits this session, ending at `cb9560d`.
Working tree is clean. **Not pushed**, that needs its own go-ahead per the
Rules section. The last two are the provisioning work: `4e0f8da` mounts a
`urllib3` retry policy on the API client and names the inquorate trap at the
error, and `cb9560d` deletes the template bake and switches the VM to a
static address assigned at clone time, taking `provision_vm.py` from 724
lines to 533.

**The blocking human step is discharged.** `PVE_TOKEN_SECRET` is in `.env`
and the new pool-scoped identity is **proven from this workstation**:
`provision_vm.py status` returned 12.5 GiB available, next free vmid 102, and
an empty pool. That last point is worth keeping: the pool being empty
independently confirms the 2026-09-01 deletion rather than a token that cannot
see its own VMs. The call also exercised this session's auth-header fix
against the live API, since an unauthenticated client gets `401` rather than
data.

**Spike A is done and it passed clean, first attempt, 2026-09-08.**
`fetch-image` downloaded the pinned image and PVE accepted the checksum;
`build-template` created VM 102, imported the disk, resized to 25G on attempt
1 of 4, and converted to a template **without ever booting it**, which is the
bake deletion working end to end. `DF_TEMPLATE_VMID=102` is recorded in
`.env`.

Four things that were unverified are now verified by that run: the
`checksum`/`checksum-algorithm` spelling on `download-url`, which was the
single least-confident claim in the provisioning research; the new storage
having the `import` content type; the pool-scoped token driving the whole
image-to-template flow; and the auth-header fix under real load.

**Phase H is done: the old identity is retired, 2026-09-08.** The exposed
`df-overseer@pve` token, live since 2026-08-24, no longer exists. Removed at a
root shell on a confirmed-quorate node: token `api`, the user, and both
`DFOverseer`/`DFOverseerNode` roles. Deleting the user took its three ACLs with
it, including a `/sdn/zones/localnetwork` grant that was **not** in this repo's
record and only surfaced because the retirement was checked before it was run,
and a `/nodes/proxmox` binding that had pointed at a node name that stopped
existing on 2026-09-02. Nothing was lost: the new identity already holds
`PVESDNUser` on that same zone. Verified both directions, that the old user,
ACLs and roles are gone **and** that `svc-df-overseer-sandbox@pve` still
exists, then re-ran `provision_vm.py status` to confirm this repo still
authenticates. **Still owed, in home-lab not here:** its
`secrets/registry.md` row goes to `retired` with the date.

**`clone` is done, 2026-09-08: VM 103 `df-colony-01` is up at
`192.168.2.201`.** User supplied `DF_VM_IP=192.168.2.201/24`. `clone --name
df-fortress.internal --full` built VM 103 from template 102 as a full clone
(matching the 2026-08-24 precedent for VM 104), `start --vmid 103` brought it
up, and `install_df.py verify --vmid 103` reached it over SSH with no address
discovery, confirming the static-assignment design works end to end on a real
build. Its FAIL lines are the expected shape for a bare clone (no DF/DFHack,
`init.txt` unset, no swap, no systemd units) — see
`decisions/DECISIONS.md` 2026-09-08 row. `DF_VMID=103` is recorded in `.env`.

**Renamed to `df-colony-01` same day, then the `.internal` convention itself
corrected twice more.** User caught the first problem: "df" already means
Dwarf Fortress, and the literal string `.internal` was showing up in the
Proxmox name field, unlike `subnet-router-01`/`-02`. First fix (wrong):
dropped `.internal` from both the Proxmox name and the guest hostname,
reasoning it was DNS-only. **Corrected by the user against home-lab's actual
convention**: the two fields split, Proxmox's name stays bare
(`df-colony-01`) and `.internal` belongs on the guest's own OS hostname
(`df-colony-01.internal`), matching `subnet-router-01` on both fields. Fixed
by hand, verified, then scripted so it isn't manual next time:
`install_df.py` gained `step_hostname`, run first (now `[1/6]`, the rest
renumbered), reading the VM's Proxmox name over the API and setting
`hostnamectl`/`/etc/hosts` to `<name>.internal`, idempotent. →
`decisions/DECISIONS.md` 2026-09-08 rows (two, the wrong read and the
correction).

**VM 103 fully installed and verified, 2026-09-08.** `install_df.py install`
ran clean (packages, swap, both tarball checksums matched, extraction,
`init.txt`), `install_df.py systemd` installed and enabled
`df-xvfb.service`/`df-fortress.service` for next boot, and
`provision_vm.py set-onboot --enable` set the Proxmox-level `onboot=1`.
`install_df.py verify` reports all checks passed, with only the two expected
`....` lines (no save dir, DF not running — no world generated yet). First
VM to go clone-to-verified purely from this repo's own scripts, no manual
VM 104-era step anywhere. → `decisions/DECISIONS.md` 2026-09-08 row.

**World generated and DF running under systemd, 2026-09-08 — first thing in
this project to run unattended.** `install_df.py gen` produced world 1 on
attempt 1 of 3 (seed 658085253, region present, 692K). Started manually first
to confirm it worked, then deliberately stopped again (`stop --save`;
quicksave was a no-op since no fort has been embarked yet, then needed
SIGKILL after the full SIGTERM timeout, the documented trap behaving exactly
as expected) because a manual instance doesn't survive a reboot. Re-started
via `install_df.py systemd --start`: `verify` now shows `dwarfort` running
(pid 11359), RPC on `127.0.0.1:5000`, not exposed off-box, both units
installed and enabled. → `decisions/DECISIONS.md` 2026-09-08 row.

**Not done yet: no fort exists.** A world was generated and DF is idling at
it, but nobody has embarked. That's the next real step, whenever it's
wanted.

**Embark-automation research done, 2026-09-08** —
`research/2026-09-08-embark-automation.md`, read-only against VM 103. Screen
sequence, keybindings for the confirmed part of the flow, and the success
check are all primary-source-confirmed from installed DFHack scripts (chiefly
`deep-embark.lua` and `gui/embark-anywhere.lua`), not guessed. The one real
gap: how "Start" on the title screen reaches a fresh embark in the existing
region, as opposed to continuing/reclaiming — no installed script exercises
that hop, so it needs live, polled testing (`dfhack.gui.getCurViewscreen()`
after each simulated key) to nail down, ideally against a snapshotted VM
state given the hard-to-reverse-actions rule. → `decisions/DECISIONS.md`
2026-09-08 row. **Next step:** either write and live-test the implementation
script against VM 103, or snapshot the VM first if that live-testing risk is
a concern.

**This research got knocked out twice by an account-wide rate limit** before
finishing on a third resume after an account switch. Worth knowing for any
session that spawns background research agents: a 429 on a background agent
doesn't lose its work if you resume the same agent (by id) rather than
starting fresh — it kept everything it had found across three attempts.

**Provisioning work completed 2026-09-08, steps 1 and 2 of the migration path
in `research/2026-09-08-provisioning-recommendation.md` §11.** Both were
unconditional and independent of the still-open build-tool decision, so most
of the practical benefit is now banked whatever happens to that. Layer 1: the
API client mounts a `urllib3` retry policy, POST deliberately excluded so a
timeout can never create two VMs, and 403/500 now say the cluster may be
inquorate. Layer 0: the template bake is deleted, `qemu-guest-agent` moved
into the guest install, and the VM's address is assigned at clone time rather
than discovered, which retired the derived MACs, the override table and the
router's reservation as a source of truth. `provision_vm.py` went 724 to 533
lines. The base image is pinned by dated serial and sha256, verified
host-side by PVE. Automatic upgrades are disabled on the guest.

**What is still open on provisioning:** whether to move image, template and
clone to OpenTofu with `bpg/proxmox`. Deliberately left at `proposed` in the
register, because the one thing nobody has tested is whether a pool-scoped
token can drive it end to end, and that is what spike B settles. Do not treat
it as decided. → `research/2026-09-08-provisioning-recommendation.md` §7.4.

**Two provisioning claims are believed but untested**, and both have a written
falsifying test. An unbaked template needs no seal (clone twice, compare SSH
host key fingerprints and `machine-id`; if they match, the bake comes back).
And `bpg`'s VMID allocation may use a workstation-local sequence file rather
than `/cluster/nextid`, which would reintroduce the second-source-of-truth
problem the 2026-08-27 `next_vmid()` decision exists to prevent.

**A live bug found and fixed this session, worth internalising the shape
of.** The same-day refactor that made `PVE_POOL`/`PVE_STORAGE` required (see
`decisions/DECISIONS.md` 2026-09-08) briefly left `scripts/pve.py`'s new
`_require()` call sitting where it broke `__init__`'s control flow, which
would have left `self.session` built with no `Authorization` header at all.
Every API call would have gone out unauthenticated and come back `401` on the
very first use of the brand-new token, reading as "the new identity doesn't
work" and sending the next session hunting in the identity/ACL layer instead
of the client code. Fixed and verified with a positive control: the check
fails against the broken code and passes against the fixed code. `pve.py`'s
current state is correct, `_require()` is a normal method and the
`Authorization` header is set unconditionally at the end of `__init__`.

**Quorum can masquerade as a permissions failure.** `citadel` has no QDevice
and the second node is resetting roughly every 2.5 hours. A single node can
drop below quorum on its own, and every config write then fails with an error
that reads exactly like an ACL problem. Run `pvecm status` before suspecting
permissions on any write that fails oddly during the rebuild.

**`.env` credential hygiene, mostly resolved 2026-09-08.** `PVE_PASSWORD` is
**deleted**: no script read it, and the credential it named was rotated out
from under it by the 2026-09-02 OS reinstall, so it was dead twice over. The
live value lives in home-lab's own store, not here. No backup file was written
when removing it, deliberately, since a `.env` sidecar is what caused this
session's near-miss. `PVE_USER` and `PVE_FQDN` were read by no code either
and are now **also deleted**, so `.env` was down to 15 keys, all of them live.
Two more went the same way later the same day: `DF_BUILD_IP` and
`DF_MAC_OVERRIDES` were leftover from decisions that already retired the code
reading them, see `decisions/DECISIONS.md` 2026-09-08 row. `.env` is now 13
keys. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` was rotated by the user the same day, 30-day
validity. Do not commit or log it.

**Assume the value that grep printed is exposed.** Deleting `PVE_PASSWORD`
required reading `.env`, which put the old password into a session transcript.
It was already superseded by the reinstall so the blast radius is nil, but the
standing convention in this repo is to treat a credential that reaches a
transcript as exposed rather than to reason about whether it mattered.

**`infra/local.proxmox-access.md` is stale and nothing else says so.** It is
gitignored, so not a leak, but it is this repo's only "access layer verified"
record and it describes the retired identity (`df-overseer@pve`, roles
`DFOverseer`/`DFOverseerNode`, token `api`), read back from the API on
2026-08-27. The new identity's own proof, the `200`-in-pool/`403`-outside
pool-fence test, lives in home-lab, not here: this repo currently has no
equivalent record of the new identity's live scopes. Worth deciding whether
re-recording that into a fresh version of the file is a Now or a Next item;
not done as part of this pass since the file is gitignored and out of scope
for it.

### Durable traps, still true, not about VM 104 specifically

- **DF ignores SIGTERM.** Quicksave before stop is mandatory once a fort is
  live; a bare stop takes the full timeout and ends in SIGKILL.
- **The manual (`start`/`stop`) and systemd-managed paths must not run at
  once — and `install_df.py stop` does not clean up after `start`.** Confirmed
  the hard way 2026-09-08: `start` launches Xvfb via `setsid nohup ... &`,
  outside systemd entirely, and `stop` only kills `dwarfort`, never that Xvfb.
  A manual Xvfb left running after `stop` becomes an orphan that silently
  poisons every later `systemd --start`: `df-xvfb.service` crash-loops
  forever against a real listener already on `:99` (not just a stale lock —
  `Restart=on-failure` retries a failure it can never fix on its own), and
  `df-fortress.service` cycles as its downstream dependency. Fix if it
  recurs: find and `kill` the orphaned Xvfb process (`ps aux | grep -i xvfb`,
  won't show up correctly in `systemctl status` since it's untracked), then
  `systemctl restart df-xvfb.service df-fortress.service`. A defensive
  `ExecStartPre` lock-file cleanup was added to `XVFB_UNIT` in
  `scripts/install_df.py` the same day, which self-heals the *stale-lock-only*
  version of this failure but not a live orphan. → `decisions/DECISIONS.md`
  2026-09-08 incident row.
- **`-gen` fails silently** roughly a quarter of the time. Success is the
  region directory existing, never the exit code.
- **Saves live at the XDG path**, not in the game directory.
- **Never convert a booted VM to a template without sealing it** (`cloud-init
  clean`, remove SSH host keys, truncate `machine-id`). The code that enforced
  this went with the bake on 2026-09-08, because a template that is never
  booted has nothing to seal. If anyone reintroduces a boot-before-convert
  step, the seal has to come back with it.
- **The published hostname is exposed.** The user chose not to rename it.
- **`willsmith.nz` is deliberate**, not a leak: the intended public face.
- **Folder is still `df-automation` on disk** while the project is
  `df-overseer`.
- **DF replay determinism is unverified.**
- **`hypothesis_id` has no registry.**
- **`openclaw` vs `hermes-agent` still deferred.**
- **Tarball checksums are pinned and enforced** as of 2026-09-08;
  `bzip2 -t` catches truncation, the sha256 catches substitution.
- **PVE's cloud-init takes only the first label of the VM `name` and discards
  everything after the first dot.** This is why VM 103 booted with the plain
  hostname `df-fortress` despite `--name df-fortress.internal`: no `--name`
  spelling can ever deliver a suffixed hostname, which is what makes
  `install_df.py`'s `step_hostname` the only workable route, not merely the
  tidier one. Found by home-lab-43 (a sibling Claude session in
  `home-lab`) reviewing this session's commit; see
  `decisions/DECISIONS.md` 2026-09-08 rows on the `.internal` convention.
- **Hostname convention has one canonical source: home-lab's `CLAUDE.md`,
  Conventions section, "Hostnames: `.internal`, on the OS hostname only."**
  Cite it, do not restate it here or in `DECISIONS.md` — restating it across
  files is exactly what produced two wrong reads of it in one session
  (2026-09-08).

### What a next session should pick up

`ROADMAP.md`'s Now bucket is the canonical list. Token pasted, `status`
verified, template and VM rebuilt, VM 103 named `df-colony-01` in Proxmox
with `df-colony-01.internal` as its OS hostname (`step_hostname` sets this
automatically now), DF/DFHack installed and verified, systemd units enabled
with `onboot=1` — all done. Remaining: generate a world and start DF
(`install_df.py gen`, then `start`) whenever that's wanted, watch for quorum
during writes, rotate the stale `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

**Style note:** the user does not want em dashes in prose. Commas, colons,
semicolons or full stops instead. Fine as structural separators.
