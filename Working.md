## Current state, 2026-09-15: the agent loop is reaching the fort, and the channel exists

The 2026-09-12 to 09-14 section (the agent architecture design phase, the
MCP server build, its first contact with reality, openclaw's install and the
first agent calls) moved wholesale to
[`working-archive/Working_archive-2026-09-14.md`](working-archive/Working_archive-2026-09-14.md).
Everything below is what is still open.

**Where things stand.**
- **The server:** `dfmcp-server.service` runs on VM 103, LAN-bound, with
  bearer tokens as the only guard until Tailscale. It is live-verified with
  relative `level` args, `isError` for script errors, and a JSON tool-call
  log in journald.
- **The agent host:** openclaw on VM 106 has run the architect twice as a
  one-shot `agent exec` on DeepSeek. Nothing is left running there.
- **The queue:** `dfqueue/` (SQLite, write-time validated, live-state
  prediction signals, a grader) exists as local code only.
- **Tests:** ambient `python -m pytest` gives 229 passed, 1 skipped;
  `.venv-dfmcp` gives 128 for `dfmcp/tests`.

### START HERE, in priority order

1. **Wire `dfqueue` into dfmcp.** **In progress 2026-09-15, user's go-ahead
   given (VM 103 included).** Phase A (local code, worktree executor) is
   dispatched: `handoffs/2026-09-15-queue-into-dfmcp.md`. Phase B (deploy,
   live verify, architect run) follows the orchestrator's review and merge.
   Design calls are in the register's 2026-09-15 "Wiring `dfqueue`" row.
   - `propose` / `pass` / `ruling` as MCP tools, scoped by role (only the
     Overseer may rule);
   - the game tick read from `overview.get` and stamped at write time;
   - the SQLite file on VM 103 with dfmcp as its single writer;
   - one live proposal from the architect through the tool, graded later.

   Designs: `docs/AGENT-ARCHITECTURE.md` §4, `dfqueue/README.md`.
2. **The feed the user wants, in order:**
   1. a grader schedule;
   2. a publisher of `dfqueue.render.public_view` only (allowlist and kill
      switch; **no delay, user's call 2026-09-14**);
   3. the stream page, noVNC left and a scrolling feed right. **Public, so
      it needs its own go-ahead.**

   It shows proposals and rulings, not agent-to-agent chat (user's call; §4
   kept).
3. **Architect run #2's regressions:** it dropped the proposal record and
   proposed a defensibility measure that `role.md` assigns to the Overseer.
   Item 1 enforces the format mechanically; the scope slip is still open.
   Only then spend on more samples per run. → `evals/live/2026-09-14-architect-second-charter/`.
4. **One supervised end-to-end cycle:** the Overseer ruling on a real
   proposal through the seam. This is the first thing that tests the
   project's actual thesis.
5. **The `set_labor`/`autolabor` race**, a live single-writer violation that
   is small to fix.

### Open, waiting on the user

- **DeepSeek key in plaintext on VM 106** in
  `/opt/openclaw/config/state/openclaw.sqlite`. openclaw 2026.9.4 has no
  headless way to store it as a reference; `openclaw secrets configure` over
  `ssh -t` might. `sudo rm -rf /opt/openclaw` removes both secrets.
- **PVE token rotation**, deferred by the user. It needs a privileged
  identity, and deleting a token drops its ACLs.
- **Tailscale**, deferred. Until then the LAN bind means tokens are the only
  guard.
- **Two deferred live checks:** whether the frame cap survives a save load,
  and whether an overlay renders in the headless pipeline.

### Owed elsewhere

- **`home-lab` `inventory/services.yaml`: an entry for `dfmcp-server.service`
  on VM 103**, owed since the unit was enabled on 2026-09-14. No live
  `home-lab` session has been available to take it, so the user needs to
  route it. VM 106 owes an entry only once openclaw runs as a service
  (nothing listens today).

### Background, not urgent

- **The breach detector is inconclusive.** Settle it opportunistically (rain,
  or an animal fording water), never by flooding the fort.
- **A stale locked worktree,** `.claude/worktrees/agent-a297451c62aa8a8a5`,
  blocks agent worktree isolation. Clean it up once no Claude process holds
  it.
- **The `../openclaw` scaffold** reads `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR` and
  `OPENCLAW_AUTH_PROFILE_SECRET_DIR`, which the image ignores; use
  `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` before running it durably.

## HANDOVER — archived

The 2026-09-12 session-end handover moved wholesale to
[`working-archive/Working_archive-2026-09-07.md`](working-archive/Working_archive-2026-09-07.md)
(file was past the ~400-line threshold). Its durable-traps list now lives
permanently at [`docs/TRAPS.md`](docs/TRAPS.md) — **read it there, and add new
traps there rather than here.** Current state is the section above.

## Archived

- Sections through 2026-09-10 (fifth handover) — provisioning build,
  perception eval, fort ledger, systemd units, title-screen bootstrap,
  live-viewing/relay/tunnel, the tileset investigation, Site Finder
  resolution, the embark-flow saga through both forts founded, and the
  seed-landmark bootstrap — all moved wholesale to
  [`working-archive/Working_archive-2026-09-07.md`](working-archive/Working_archive-2026-09-07.md)
  as each was superseded or reported itself finished.
- 2026-09-09: the 2026-09-08 (evening) handover moved wholesale to the
  same archive file.
- 2026-09-09 (end of session): this session's full handover (title-screen
  bootstrap resolution, the entire live-viewing/relay/tunnel build, the
  tileset investigation, and the Site Finder "Begin" resolution) moved
  wholesale to the same archive file — exceeded the ~400-line threshold,
  not superseded. The handover above is the tight current-state summary;
  the archive has the full detail.
- 2026-09-10: the 2026-09-09 (end of session) handover moved wholesale to
  the same archive file, superseded by this session's own handover above
  (Cloudflare Tunnel completion, the graphics-completeness fix, and the
  live embark-flow attempt).
- 2026-09-10 (second handover today): that session's own handover moved
  wholesale to the same archive file, superseded by this session's handover
  above (the click-registration mystery resolved, the real embark mechanism
  found, and the new "Confirm" crash).
- 2026-09-10 (third handover today): that session's own handover moved
  wholesale to the same archive file, superseded by this session's handover
  above — **the first fort was founded**, and the "Confirm" crash resolved
  empirically via gdb.
- 2026-09-10 (fourth handover today): that session's own handover moved
  wholesale to the same archive file, superseded by this session's handover
  above — the `find_mm_*`/`warn_mm_*` coordinate-frame bug found, and
  `xdotool` real-input fix for headless map/hover interaction discovered
  and validated.
- 2026-09-10 (fifth handover today): that session's own handover moved
  wholesale to the same archive file, superseded by the handover at the top
  of this file — the text-only sweep built and run, a Windows-specific SSH
  command-line truncation bug found and fixed in `provision_vm.ssh_guest`/
  `install_df.remote()`, and a strong second-site candidate found
  (`sx=128 sy=84 ex=131 ey=87`), left uncommitted for the user's call.
- 2026-09-10 (end of session): that handover's full continuation (the
  candidate embarked, Artobcatten's save lost as a result, the
  perception-layer branch split, the quorum-blocked snapshot worked
  around with a file backup, and Uniboslan's first room and stockpile dug)
  moved wholesale to the same archive file — exceeded the ~400-line
  threshold, not superseded by new work. The handover at the top of this
  file is the compacted current-state summary; the embark-screen-specific
  durable traps it used to carry were dropped rather than re-copied
  forward, since they're already the permanent living content of
  `docs/DF-UI-AUTOMATION.md`, not duplicated here.
- 2026-09-11: the 2026-09-11 VM-outage/quorum-incident writeup plus the
  entire 2026-09-10 end-of-session handover (VNC control channel, labor
  management/`autolabor`, the kea-combat finding, the quicksave root-cause,
  the perception-branch audit, both autonomous-play experiments, and the
  `find_diggable_area`/reachability corrections) moved wholesale to the
  same archive file — exceeded the ~400-line threshold by a wide margin,
  not superseded by new work. The handover at the top of this file is the
  compacted current-state summary, written deliberately thorough for a
  `/clear`; the archive has the full decision-by-decision detail.
- 2026-09-11 (documentation consistency pass): three fully-self-reporting
  ### threads moved wholesale to the same archive file: the compliance
  eval harness build (done for the session), mechanical prediction grading
  (built, selftested), and the full find_diggable_area/dig_diggable_area
  saga (built, live-verified, live-tested, the quickfort `-c` top-left-vs-
  center bug found and fixed, re-confirmed working end to end). None were
  gated on a human; item 10 in "What actually got built today" above now
  carries the compacted find_diggable_area/dig summary, and
  `decisions/DECISIONS.md`'s 2026-09-11 rows carry the full trail for all
  three.
- 2026-09-12: the entire 2026-09-11 end-of-session handover (the
  branch-merge question, the "what got built" list through item 12, and
  the peer-sessions/next-steps section) moved wholesale to the same
  archive file — the branch-merge question it spent most of its length on
  is resolved (merged, above), so it's fully superseded, not just over
  the line-count threshold. The handover at the top of this file is the
  new compacted current state.
- 2026-09-12 (session end, ahead of a `/clear`): this session's own content
  (the tool manifest build, both coordinate-leak fixes through deploy and
  live-verification, and the quorum correction) moved wholesale to the same
  archive file — it reports itself fully finished, nothing left gated on a
  human except the already-deferred design-commitment-#1 wording entry,
  carried forward unchanged. The handover at the top of this file is the
  fresh compacted current state, including two corrections the archived
  version's own text no longer reflects: both coordinate leaks are now
  fixed/deployed/verified (the archived text still frames them as open in
  a couple of places), and the driving-brain choice (`openclaw`) and
  live-view-ingest shelving are both folded in as settled state rather than
  same-session news.
- 2026-09-15: the whole 2026-09-12 to 09-14 section (the agent architecture design phase, the MCP server build and live smoke test, the durable deploy, openclaw install and first agent calls, both architect charter runs, the relative-LEVEL, isError and call-log fixes, and the dfqueue and live-signals builds) moved wholesale to
  [`working-archive/Working_archive-2026-09-14.md`](working-archive/Working_archive-2026-09-14.md).
  The file was 893 lines. Every still-open item was carried into the current-state section at the top.
